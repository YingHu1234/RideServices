## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Understand the dataset, estimate the charged rate, identify patterns, and determine the best locations for drivers to pick up customers to achieve a higher charge rate.

### Prerequisites
SQL, Tableau, Python or Jupyter Notebook 


## üîñ Data Cleaning <a name = "data_leaning"></a>

Basic information of the dataset (please refer to Appendices on the page 10, 11 and 12)

    a.	Original record: 1337759 rows, 20 columns
  
    b.	Data: continuous data (regression models)
  
    c.	Duplicates: No duplicates
  
    d.	Outliners: 17997 rows were removed
  
        i.	Three rows (RateCodeID=99, which were not explained on the data dictionary)
        ii.	17994 rows (Trip distance was 0, but the fare amount was more than $100)
    e.	Null values: 1337759 counts on the ‚ÄúEhail_fee‚Äù column.
    
        i.	The null values were updated into 0 
        
    f.	Final record: 1319765 rows, 20 columns

Tools were used for this project: Python, MySQL, and Tableau

    a.	Viewed the dataset and imported it into Mysql: Python

1.	Which vendor had the most trips? How many trips were taken?

    Vendor #2 VeriFone Inc had the most and 1036551 were taken. 
    (Please refer to the below screenshot)

3.	Please pull the records with the highest fare or passenger_count by date (day)‚Äô

    Please refer to the below screenshot:

4.	Estimate the charged rate for each RateCodeID. (For this question, assume rates are only charged based on distance. )

    ‚Ä¢	Forecast model is applied to predict the charged rate 
    ‚Ä¢	It is for the next week from July 1st, 2014, to July 12th, 2014. 
    ‚Ä¢	The orange/red line is the trend of the charged rate. Please refer to the below screenshot:

5.	What was the average difference between the driven distance and the haversine distance of the trip?

    The average difference was 8 miles:
        ‚Ä¢	Calculations for two points: Pickup point & Dropoff point
              o	Pickup Point=MAKEPOINT([Pickup latitude],[Pickup longitude])
              o	Dropoff point=MAKEPOINT([Dropoff latitude],[Dropoff longitude])
        ‚Ä¢	Calculation for Haversine distance: 15,185,531 miles.
              o	Haversine distance=Distance([Pickup Point],[Dropoff Point],'mi')
        ‚Ä¢	Average difference calculation: 8 miles
              o	AVG([Haversine distance]-[Trip distance])
        ‚Ä¢	Please refer to the below screenshot
